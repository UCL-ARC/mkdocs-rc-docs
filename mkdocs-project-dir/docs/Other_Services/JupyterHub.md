# JupyterHub

## Overview

The Research Computing team provide a JupyterHub service
([jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/hub)) primarily to support
teaching and is part of the Data
Science Platform. It uses the central UNIX filestore for user data. 

## Access

To access the service go to the following URL:

<https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/>

and login with your UCL userid and password.

The Data Science Platform and all of its components are only
accessible from the UCL network. When off campus, you will need to
connect to the
[UCL VPN](https://ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/ucl-virtual-private-network-vpn)
first.

**Please note:** The main aim of this service is to support teaching
  and the service should not be used for computationally intensive
  research. If your use starts to affect the experience of other
  users, we reserve the right to terminate sessions without
  notice. For computationally intensive
  research you should be using the [Myriad Cluster](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Myriad/).
