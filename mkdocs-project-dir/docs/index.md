## Email Support

For support for any of our services or to report a problem with any of our computing platforms, contact us at: [rc-support@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk)

We will endeavour to answer queries on any aspect of computing related to your research,
whatever your skill level or requirements.

## How to...

- [Connect to the Research Data Storage service](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/platforms-services/research-data-storage-service/live-storage-access-guide)
- [Access services from outside UCL](howto.md#logging-in-from-outside-the-ucl-firewall)
- [Apply for access to national GPU clusters](Supplementary/GPU_Clusters.md)
- [Get more resources](Additional_Resource_Requests.md) (more storage, more
  compute time, longer run time, etc)
- [Acknowledge the use of RC Systems](Clusters/Acknowledging_RC_Systems.md)

## Training

We have an online Moodle course "Introduction to the Unix Shell" and
infrequently provide a training course aimed at getting users up and running on
one of our main clusters. ["Introduction to the Unix Shell (Moodle)](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=12953) (UCL users), [GitHub-Pages](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/intro-unix-shell/index.html) (non-UCL users), additional resources can be found on [UCL mediacentral](https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk).

We have an online Moodle course "Introduction to High Performance Computing at UCL" aimed at 
getting users comfortable with using HPC at UCL. ["Introduction to High Performance Computing at UCL" (Moodle)](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=33216) 
(UCL users), [UCL mediacentral](https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk) and search for "HPC" (non-UCL users). 

We run some instances of these courses between specified dates with scheduled 
online tutorial sessions or they can be done self-service at any time.

Please see our
[ARC Training page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/education/training)
for details of when the taught versions of these courses are run.
