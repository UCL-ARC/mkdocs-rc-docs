# Additional Resource Requests

We recognise that researchers may sometimes require a higher throughput
of work than it is possible to achieve with free ‘fair share’ usage of
[Myriad](Clusters/Myriad.md) and [Kathleen](Clusters/Kathleen.md).

There are a couple of ways of obtaining additional Myriad / Kathleen resources
beyond this fair share:

## Make a special request to the Computational Resource Allocation Group (CRAG) for free access to additional resources

Users who wish to request additional resources or reserve resources
beyond those provided can complete the additional resource request form
in collaboration with your supervisor or the project's principal
investigator. This includes requests for increased storage quotas.

The completed form should be sent to the Research Computing Platforms
team at <mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>, for technical review. If successful,
your case will be presented to the
[CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) for
consideration at the next meeting of the Group. The
[CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) meets
monthly, usually on the third Friday of the month, and users will be
informed of the Group’s decision as soon as possible after their next
meeting.

Note that an application to the
[CRAG](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/about/governance/research-it/crag) for
additional resources is only likely to be approved if the impact on
other users is not deemed to be significant, or of long duration.

## Request hosting of shared datasets

We have provision for hosting shared datasets for users on Myriad. These
can be datasets that are freely accessible by all users, or ones limited
to groups.

Hosted datasets:

- Will not be backed up.
- Must have a named primary contact.
- Must be reapplied for every 12 months to make sure they are still
  current and required.
- Will have an associated quota.
- Will be removed when renewal lapses (notice will be given).

They are likely to be managed by a role account - access to the role
account will be by ssh key.

To apply for a hosted dataset, please send this form to
<mailto:rc-support@ucl.ac.uk>.

## Purchase dedicated compute nodes or priority cycles on Myriad

Researchers may purchase additional resources to be used as part of the
[Myriad](Clusters/Myriad.md) High Performance Computing cluster if the free
service does not meet their needs. See Paid-for resources:
[Purchasing in Myriad](Paid-For_Resources/Purchasing_in_Myriad.md) for details.
