# Planned Outages

Full details of outages are emailed to the cluster-specific user lists. 

Generally speaking, an outage will last from the morning of the first date listed until mid-morning of the end date listed. The nodes may need to be emptied of jobs in advance ('drained'), so jobs may remain in the queue for longer before an outage begins.

If there is a notable delay in bringing the system back we will contact you after approximately midday - please don't email us at 9am on the listed end days!

After an outage, the first day or two back should be considered 'at risk'; that is, things are more likely to go wrong without warning and we might need to make adjustments.

09 Feb 2021 8-1pm   | Young   | Planned | Gold and job submission outage while we migrate our database server.
