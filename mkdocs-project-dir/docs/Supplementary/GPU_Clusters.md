UCL users may be able to access the following GPU clusters.

## National GPU clusters

There are two nationally-accessible EPSRC Tier 2 HPC centres with GPUs.

Access is generally managed through calls to an EPSRC Resource
Allocation Panel

  - [Tier 2 RAP calls](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/tier2hpcservices/)
  - [Filterable page for all open EPSRC calls](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/)

There may also be pump-priming/proof of concept access available.

General information about machines with external access is available at
[HPC-UK](http://www.hpc-uk.ac.uk/facilities/).
